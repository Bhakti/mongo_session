Spin up a NoSQL cluster in minutes with the MongoDB Atlas: Hosted Database as a Service
It is easiest way to start learning and prototyping applications on MongoDB.

Launching an application on any database typically requires careful planning to ensure performance, high availability, security, and disaster recovery – and these obligations continue as long as you run the application. 
With MongoDB Atlas, you receive all of the features of MongoDB without any of the operational heavy lifting, allowing you to focus instead on learning and building your apps. 

Features include:
	On-demand, pay as you go model
	Seamless upgrades and auto-healing
	Fully elastic. Scale up and down with ease
	Deep monitoring & customizable alerts
	Highly secure by default
	Continuous backups with point-in-time recovery


* Create a account on mongo atlas
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/atlas-free-tier-setup/#create-free-tier-manual
Create an Atlas user account.
Create an Atlas Organization.
	Organizations are top-level hierarchy structures. You configure alerts and billing for paid clusters at the organization level, and all projects and clusters part of that organization inherit those settings.
	
Create an Atlas Project
	Projects manage related MongoDB deployments, or “clusters” in Atlas. An organization can contain multiple projects
	Add Members to the Project

Create a cluster.	
	MongoDB clusters can be either a replica set or a sharded cluster. To create a cluster, go to the Clusters view and click the Build a New Cluster button.
		Enter a Cluster Name.
		Select Amazon Web Services as the Cloud Provider.
		For Region, chose either US-EAST-1 or EU-CENTRAL-1.
		Click the Select button for Instance Size M0 for Atlas Free Tier.
		Click Confirm & Deploy.
		
Setup security
	Atlas only allows client connections to the cluster from entries in the projects’s whitelist. To add an entry to the whitelist:
	Click the Security tab from the Clusters view.
Click IP Whitelist, then Add IP Address. You may either enter the IP address manually in the Whitelist Entry field or click the Add Current IP Address button.
Click Confirm and wait for Atlas to update the firewall.
